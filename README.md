# bikeshare-2
I chose Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
